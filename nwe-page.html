            About Being Professional
What does it take to be a professional? Is it about how much you know? About knowing your topic inside out? Of course it is. But it‘s only one part of the equation.
The other part is about using the right tools and cultivating the right habits. You won‘t  nd a  ve-star chef who works with a cheap knife - he knows that he will produce better results and work safer with the best tool for the job. Similarly, you won‘t  nd a professional ten- nis player who doesn‘t train his endurance - he knows that tennis isn‘t just about hitting the ball across the net.
